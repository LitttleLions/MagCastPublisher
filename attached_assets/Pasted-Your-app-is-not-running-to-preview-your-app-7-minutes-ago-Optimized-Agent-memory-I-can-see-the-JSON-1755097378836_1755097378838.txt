I can see the JSON import is working now (the logs show successful creation of issues and articles), but there are two frontend errors that need fixing:

    A JavaScript error: magazine.sections.slice(...).map is not a function - this suggests the sections data is being stored as a JSON string but the frontend expects an array
    The workflow finished instead of staying running

Let me fix these issues:

The port is already in use. Let me kill any existing processes and fix the frontend error, then restart properly:

Now let me find and fix the sections parsing issue in the frontend. The error shows magazine.sections.slice(...).map is not a function, which means the sections field is being stored as a JSON string but the frontend expects an array:

I need to find where the sections data is being used in the frontend that's causing the error. Let me search for the specific error pattern:

Found it! The error is at sections.slice(0, 2).map(). Let me view that part of the code and fix the sections parsing issue:

Perfect! I found the issue. The code is already handling the sections parsing correctly - it's trying to parse JSON strings and convert them to arrays. However, there seems to be another place where sections is used without this protection. Let me now restart the application properly and ensure the sections issue is fully fixed:

Great! The server is now running successfully. Let me check if the JSON import functionality is working and test the application:

I see the issue! The QueryClient is not imported correctly in App.tsx. Let me fix this:

I can see the issue! The App.tsx file is trying to create a new QueryClient using new QueryClient() but it's not importing the QueryClient class. Instead, it should be using the already configured queryClient from the lib file. Let me fix this:

Perfect! The hot module reloading shows that the fix is working. Now let me test the application to make sure it's fully functional:
